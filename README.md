breast-cancer-wisconsinusing svm and decision tree 

Here we are using the breast cancer databases which conists of two target class 2 for bengin and 4 for malignant 
it consists of 700 rows and 11 columns we are using the two type of algorithms one is Support vector machince and 
other is using decision tree they are two branches master and model2. 
Breast cancer databases using svm is located in master branches and using decision tree is located under model2
we have evaluated the models accuracy using accuracy_score matrix and confusion matrix
